# augmentedballs
Prototype works, still experimental. Use a bunch of tennis balls at once as Augmented Reality (AR) game controllers in phone browser or desktop browser, low to mid latency. Carry balls in your pocket and hold them over the phone, hand balls to people for shared screen multiplayer. Make your own games in javascript. Use with any other controllers such as bluetooth xbox paired to phone (browser gamepad api). Small self contained html file. To get webcam permission it needs to be either on localhost or a https website, but its static content, just a file. Will have a bunch of these networked together later, triangulating ball 3d positions such as thousands of people play augmented reality games with tennis balls in a public park using android firefox browser (fast, or chrome, for example, hopefully all browsers will support) to a qrcode or url. Make games while you're out and try them with whoever is nearby and wants to play. The world is our hackerspace. The metaverse should not be owned by anyone, instead be a bunch of stuff that fits together.
